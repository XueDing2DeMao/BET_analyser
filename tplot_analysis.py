tplot_analysis.py — T-Plot Analysis (two-segment construction)
==============================================================
Determines:
  - Total surface area        (line 1, through the origin)
  - External surface area     (line 2 slope; meso + macro)
  - Micropore surface area    (total - external)
  - Micropore volume          (line 2 intercept, via the Gurvich factor)
  - Mean pore diameter (2t)   (bend point of the two lines)

Method (two-segment t-plot)
---------------------------
The t-method fits *two* lines to the adsorption isotherm plotted as adsorbed
amount V against statistical film thickness t (a "t-plot"):

    Line 1 — through the ORIGIN, low-t region:
             slope -> TOTAL surface area
    Line 2 — after micropore filling is complete:
             slope     -> EXTERNAL surface area
             intercept -> MICROPORE VOLUME (Gurvich factor)
    Micropore surface area = total - external
    Bend point (intersection of lines 1 and 2) -> mean pore radius t;
             2t = mean pore diameter, unreliable if 2t < 0.7 nm

A non-porous sample gives a single straight line through the origin (line 1
only); a mesoporous sample deviates *upward* from line 1 as capillary
condensation sets in. This module fits both segments and reports the derived
quantities; a sample with no detectable micropore region is reported with a
"no meaningful bend" flag rather than a forced split.

Data-sufficiency gate
---------------------
Line 1 needs adsorption points in the micropore-filling region (p/p0 < 0.08,
Thommes et al. 2015 §6.1). If the data has fewer than ``MIN_LINE1_POINTS``
points there, the micropore quantities (V_micro, S_micro, S_total, t_bend, 2t)
cannot be determined and are returned as ``None`` with
``micropore_analysis_possible`` False; the external surface area (line 2) is
still reported on its own. This is a *measurement limitation*, not a value of
zero — returning 0.0 here would read as "confirmed no micropores" when the
truth is "this measurement cannot answer the question".

Reference t-curve
-----------------
The reference t-curve must be measured on a non-porous sample with the *same
surface chemistry* as the analyte (Microtrac AppNote B-AD-009). Model formulas
are offered alongside measured references:

    Equation 1 (definition of the reference t-curve):
        t = 0.354 * V/Vm   [nm]   (N2 @ 77.4 K, hexagonal close packing)

Two model formulas are implemented here; the choice is explicit via the
``reference_curve`` argument (default "harkins-jura"):

  * "harkins-jura" — t = sqrt(13.99 / (0.034 - log10(P/P0)))  [Angstrom]
      derives from oxidic surfaces; treat cautiously for carbonaceous or
      non-polar surfaces.
  * "halsey"        — t = 3.54 * (-5 / ln(P/P0))**(1/3)        [Angstrom]

On the two instrument files that carry their own t-plot values (`10.xls`,
`14H.xls`), Halsey reproduced the instrument's *total* area `a1` to 2.3-2.5 %
versus 8.6-12 % for Harkins-Jura. Harkins-Jura remains the default only for
backward compatibility; the choice is exposed and should be revisited per
sample. Separately, `S_external/S_BET` rises monotonically with falling BET C
across the five audit samples, crossing 1.0 near C ≈ 65 (g-OH 1.489 at C 9.3,
9(BC) 1.234 at 32.1, 13BgOH 1.176 at 34.5, 10 1.069 at 57.6, 14H 0.960 at
95.8). With n = 5 this is indicative, not proven — it is reported here as a
correlation, not asserted as causation.

A tabulated reference curve (e.g. graphitised carbon black, GCB) can be added
later as a data file: register it in ``REFERENCE_CURVES`` (a plain
name -> callable mapping) without touching the fitting code. The fitting only
sees the resulting t array.

    Fit the two-segment t-plot construction of Lippens & de Boer.

    Line 1 (through the origin, low-t) gives the total surface area; line 2
    (free intercept, high-t) gives the external surface area (slope) and the
    micropore volume (intercept x Gurvich factor).

    Bend-point detection scans every split that leaves at least
    ``MIN_SEGMENT_POINTS`` in each segment and keeps line 2 at/above
    ``split_t_min``; for each, line 1 is fit through the origin
    (``slope = sum(t*v)/sum(t**2)``) and line 2 by ordinary least squares.

    The three physical-validity constraints of a t-plot decomposition
        * ``slope_1 > slope_2``    (micropore filling is the steeper region)
        * ``intercept_2 >= 0``
        * ``S_external <= S_total``
    are enforced *during* the scan: a split violating any of them is excluded,
    so a physically impossible decomposition (in particular ``S_external >
    S_total``) is never returned. ``2t >= 0.7 nm`` is a *reliability* statement
    (B-AD-009), not a validity gate, so it is flagged rather than used to reject
    a genuine bend. Among the valid splits the one with the lowest total SSE is
    selected. If no split satisfies the three validity constraints, the window
    admits no two-segment decomposition and ``None`` is returned (the caller
    should fall back to a single origin line — see :func:`fit_tplot_model`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    t, v : array-like — statistical thickness (Å) and adsorbed amount

        line 2 up to ``t_max``.
